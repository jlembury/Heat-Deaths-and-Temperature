# :sunny: Heat-Related Deaths in the 48 States
### An analysis of temperature distribution and hyperthermia from 1999 - 2016

This research project that uses Jupyter Notebooks, Python, R, and ArcGIS Pro to analyze relationships between US heat deaths and temperature variables.

The NOAA API was used to retrieve temperature data which was then processed using the pandas library. This dataset was merged with heat-death data retrieved from CDC Wonder. Geopandas was used to create shapefiles that were exported for use in R Studio and ArcGIS Pro. A statistical analysis, including a geographically weighted regression (GWR), was completed using R script. Data visualization was completed in ArcGIS Pro.

This project was presented at the 2020 San Diego State University Student Research Symposium. Check out the [POSTER](https://gisjess.com/img/SRS2020%20Poster.jpg).
